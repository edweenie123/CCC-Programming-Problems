# Canadian Computing Competition (CCC):
This repository will contain my solutions to some the problems on the Canadian Computing Competition (CCC).

Most of the solutions are written in Python3 and therefore don't have the best runtimes.

All solutions were tested on the the judges on https://dmoj.ca/ and https://cccgrader.com/
